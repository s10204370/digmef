<p><h2>He gave us statutes that are flawed and laws that we could not live by.</h2></p>
<p><h2>He let us become defiled through our gifts, which he fills us with horror so we would know that he is the LORD.</h2></p>
<p><h2>We try to grasp the stars during our mortal lives. Failing to realise that we are insignificantly puny in this large universe.</h2></p>
<p><h2>No matter if we stay on the ground or fly in the air, we will burn in the end.</h2></p>
<p><h2>Don't let the unwise ones deceive you. Their bodies and souls are corrupt to the core.</h2></p>
<p><h2>Hold up the righteousness in your eyes and take the blade to get rid of their sins.</h2></p>
<p><h2>Drink their blood. Eat their flesh. We shall burn in the flames together.</h2></p>

<p><b>Brothers and sisters of the Lord, I call to you on this glorious day to gather in prayer, for we are in times of filth and sins across this world and we can no long stand idle.</b></p>
<p><b>I implore all of you to open your third eye and join me in the mission to cleanse the world.</b></p>
<p><b>The world shall know true pain.</b></p>
<i><p>Open your third eye and see the past that haunts us.</p>
<p>Open your third eye and see the future repeating it's mistakes.</p>
<p>Open your third eye and see the sins that's plaguing this world.</p>
<p>Open your third eye and see the truth in all the lies.</p>
<p>Open your third eye and see the Him, the one true Lord.</p>
<p>Open your third eye and see the real world.</p></i>
<p><b>The link at the <u>bottom</u> of the page will open your third eye.</b></p>
<p><b>Brothers and sisters, we shall meet each other when we cross this mortal plane and enter the celestial plane. Beware of the False Shepherd that hides among us...</b></p>
<p><b>NON-BELIEVERS SHALL PERISH SHOULD THEY TRY TO RECEIVE THE ABILITY GRANTED BY OUR ONE TRUE LORD!</b></p>
